# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

Yes, this has been a lot! I have had to learn a lot outside of the lessons as well. It was challenging!

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

Even with breaks, it is taxing to have a very active brain for 10 hours a day.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

Not sure how to answer this but I am pretty fried. I hope that mod 0 will help me be as ready as I can be?
